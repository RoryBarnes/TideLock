This subdirectory contains scripts and data relevant to Kepler detections.
The All directory contains raw statistics from NExSci, and scripts to process
the data into Fig. 5 and Table 1. Note that those scripts require both EQTIDE
and HITE. Also, one script uses Perl (horrors!) as I used it for a previous 
study. The Kepler22b directory provides the script used to gerenate Fig. 3.
